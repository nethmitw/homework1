What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?
- with merge you are trying to update your local repo to a working 
directory while with rebase you are trying to update the start of your 
branche to a later commit that happened after you branched out.

What is a remote repository?
- a remote repository is hosted in a server that all members of the team
has access to.
